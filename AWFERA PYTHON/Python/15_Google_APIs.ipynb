    "### **Step 1: Introduction to Google AI Studio**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Google AI Studio is a platform that provides access to Google’s AI models, called **Gemini models**.\n",
    "* You can use these models through **APIs in Python** to build advanced AI applications.\n",
    "* The lecture focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Advanced features of AI APIs.\n",
    "  * Best practices for understanding and debugging code.\n",
    "  * Encouraging **self-learning** to work with new and evolving AI platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Advanced Features in AI APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-Turn Conversations:**\n",
    "  APIs allow creating chat sessions where the AI remembers previous messages (like ChatGPT).\n",
    "  This helps in building conversational agents that can maintain context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Configurable Parameters:**\n",
    "  You can control how the model behaves using parameters like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **max output length** – controls how long the response can be.\n",
    "  * **top P** and **top K** – control randomness and output diversity.\n",
    "  * **temperature** – controls creativity/randomness in responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexibility:**\n",
    "  APIs let you experiment with outputs, customize responses, and create different chat sessions based on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### **Step 3: Learning and Understanding API Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus on understanding **concepts and logic flow** before diving into line-by-line syntax.\n",
    "* Use AI tools like **ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Perplexity** to help you understand code.\n",
    "* Practice coding with small exercises to learn how APIs work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Managing API Keys and Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "* API keys are like passwords that let you access Google’s services.\n",
    "* Keys used in demo notebooks are removed before public release for security.\n",
    "* You must **add your own API key** to run the code.\n",
    "* **Never share your keys** publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Python Environment and Debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Language Choice:**\n",
    "  Python is the main language in this guide, but you can also use other languages like Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Debugging:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Step through the code **cell by cell** to find errors.\n",
    "  * Use debugging tools to **check variable values** and understand how the program flows. \n",
    "\n",
    "  ### **Step 6: Google AI Studio Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is Google AI Studio?**\n",
    "  It’s a centralized platform for Google’s AI models called **Gemini**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Capabilities include: **text generation, conversation, content analysis, and multi-modal tasks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Setting Up Google Client in Python:**\n",
