    "# 1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification problems**. Despite its name, it is not a regression algorithm like Linear Regression. Instead, it is used when the **output variable is categorical**, most commonly binary (e.g., 0 or 1, Yes or No, True or False).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **1. Purpose of Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of Logistic Regression is to **predict the probability** that a given input point belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Email is spam (1) or not spam (0)\n",
    "* A customer will churn (1) or not churn (0)\n",
    "* A tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **2. Basic Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression works like Linear Regression at the start:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\cdots + w_nx_n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value $z$ is called the **logit** or **linear combination of inputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead of predicting $z$ directly, we **pass it through a special function** called the **sigmoid function** to convert it into a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **3. Sigmoid (Logistic) Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function is a mathimetical function used to map the predicted values to probablities. The S-form curve is called sigmoid function. In Logistic regression we use the concept of threshold value, which define the probalibilty of 1 either 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $z$ is very large → output ≈ 1\n",
    "* If $z$ is very small → output ≈ 0\n",
    "* If $z = 0$ → output = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: S(X) = 1/(1+e^(-X))\n",
    "\n",
    "This output is interpreted as a **probability** that the input belongs to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 **4. Prediction Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the probability from the sigmoid function, you apply a threshold (usually 0.5):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{if } \\sigma(z) \\geq 0.5 \\Rightarrow \\text{class } 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{if } \\sigma(z) < 0.5 \\Rightarrow \\text{class } 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **5. Cost Function (Loss Function)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For Logistic Regression, the cost function is based on **Log Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ y^{(i)} \\log(\\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}^{(i)}) \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y$ = actual label\n",
    "* $\\hat{y}$ = predicted probability\n",
    "* $m$ = number of training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to **minimize this cost function** using optimization methods like **Gradient Descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 **6. Training Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize weights $w$ and bias $b$\n",
    "2. Calculate $z = w^Tx + b$\n",
    "3. Apply sigmoid to get predicted probability\n",
    "4. Calculate loss using log loss\n",
    "5. Update weights using **gradient descent**\n",
    "6. Repeat until convergence\n",

    "* Not suitable for complex non-linear problems\n",
